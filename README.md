## Methods

- #### `getAllSms()`
Retrieves all SMS messages from modem. This array includes sent, received, unread, draft and failed messages.
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with array of message objects. Each message has a `tag` property by which you can check message type:

| ----- | ------------------- |
| `'0'` | Received sms        |
| `'1'` | Unread received sms |
| `'2'` | Sent sms            |
| `'3'` | Failed sent sms     |
| `'4'` | Draft sms           |

Example of `message` object
```js
{
  id: '148',
  number: '+386123456789',
  content: 'Cool ðŸ˜Ž',
  tag: '0',
  date: '25/01/24 19:56:09',
  draft_group_id: '',
  received_all_concat_sms: '1',
  concat_sms_total: '0',
  concat_sms_received: '0',

}
```

(async () => {
  try {
    await myModem.sendSms('000000000', 'My message');
    // Add some timeout if you want that above sent message
    // is included in immediate next call to retrieve all messages.
    // Although ZTE modem returns a response that action was completed,
    // it does not refresh it's internal state right away.
    await setTimeout(500);
