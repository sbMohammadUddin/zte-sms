Tested with model `MF79U`.

## Methods

- #### `getAllSms()`
Retrieves all SMS messages from modem. This array includes sent, received, unread, draft and failed messages.
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with array of message objects. Each message has a `tag` property by which you can check message type: 

| tag   | meaning             |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| `'0'` | Received sms        |
| `'1'` | Unread received sms |
| `'2'` | Sent sms            |
| `'3'` | Failed sent sms     |
| `'4'` | Draft sms           |

Example of `message` object
```js
{
  id: '148',
  number: '+386123456789',
  content: 'Cool 😎',
  tag: '0',
  date: '25/01/24 19:56:09',
  draft_group_id: '',
  received_all_concat_sms: '1',
  concat_sms_total: '0',
  concat_sms_received: '0',
  sms_class: '4'
}
```

- #### `sendSms(number, message)`
`number [string]` - phone number of the sms recipient
`message [string]` - sms message

Sends the SMS to a given number.
Returns a `Promise` that resolves if SMS was sent and is rejected otherwise.

- #### `setSmsAsRead(smsIds)`
`smsIds [Array<String>]` - array of sms IDs you want to mark as read. 

Sets the status of the received SMS with given id to read.
Have in mind that you can only mark SMS as read if it has a `tag` of `1` that then becomes `0`.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves if SMS messages were successfully marked as read.

Returns a `Promise` that resolves if SMS messages were successfully deleted.

- #### `deleteAllSms()`
Deletes ALL SMS messages from ZTE modem regardless of the tag ('received', 'sent', 'unread', 'failed', 'drafts').
Returns a `Promise` that resolves if SMS messages were successfully deleted.

- #### `getSmsCapacityInfo()`
Returns a `Promise` that resolves with a modem SMS capacity info object.

Example:
```js
{
  sms_nv_total: '100',
  sms_sim_total: '20',
  sms_nvused_total: '30',
  sms_nv_rev_total: '3',

## Usage
Construct new instance of the Modem with IP of the modem and modem password:

```js
const Modem = require('@zigasebenik/zte-sms');
const myModem = new Modem({ modemIP: '192.168.0.1', modemPassword: 'password'});

(async () => {
  try {
    await myModem.sendSms('000000000', 'My message');
    // Add some timeout if you want that above sent message
    // is included in immediate next call to retrieve all messages.
    // Although ZTE modem returns a response that action was completed,
    // it does not refresh it's internal state right away.
    await setTimeout(500);
    const allSMSMessages = await myModem.getAllSms();
    console.log(allSMSMessages);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
